# MARA

# ABSTRACT

Its more than an year COVID-19 pandemic came we were quarantined in our house. Hospitals were rushed with patients affected by this disease. Now the second wave is started.
The main reason our government announced lockdown is for preventing disease spreading due to man to man contact and overcrowding. But still in Hospitals, election campaigns, etc. man to man contact without proper social distancing and overcrowding is happening. Even though they have done preventive measures still there is a high risk of spreading.
So this gave us a idea to build a robotic arm which is not complex with programming and can be controlled by each and every person using knowledge of 8th standard science.
This project MARA is a robotic arm build with only motors and switch's making it easier to operate, repair and use in medical stream, shops, etc.
